Having passed security, we're sitting in the Terminal 1 Starbucks sipping frapalapachinos(tm) and eating skinny muffins(tm). We do have the best view of the planes however and intend to sit here for at least another two hours to avoid the rest of the holiday makers. No sign of any Finnair planes however. I still think the airline is an elaborate scam. They even use the thin air joke in their advertising. Check out perhaps the most over engineered website ever developed. Try and get even one piece of useful information from their website:

So, update on the planes. I can see row after row of Thomas Cook 757-200s which isn't very interesting. There is a tiny plane in the distance with propellers that looks like it might take about 10 people. I'm assuming that's our plane. It looks like they're trying to reattach one of the propellers which isn't massively reassuring. Oooh oohh! One's taking off. Sorry this is pretty dull.

Nicola's going to take this opportunity to test that this computer supports Japanese text. So make sure your browsers are calibrated for foreign:

Nicola in katakana:

ニコラ

and in hiragana:

にこら

You pronounce it Ni-ko-ra. David is a bit harder unfortunately. It has a little tsu character in it that we have no idea how to do on an qwerty keyboard. Nicola's going to give it a go in katakana:

ダビイツド

There we go. You pronounce that Da-bid-do. Anyway, that's the ned of today's Japanese lesson. Chris is flying out from the same terminal today so we're off to go and find him before he gets captured by the win-a-super-car gangsters parked in the departure lounge.
