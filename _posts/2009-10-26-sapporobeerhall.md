We were feeling rather bleary eyed after the 12 hour journey so in an effort to
stay awake we chose one of the more lively places in town to grab a couple of
beers and a bite to eat, the Lion beer hall. This is the flagship of the
Sapporo brewery and is a German style beer hall complete with a Mosaic behind
the bar, dark wood paneling and cozy lighting.

We queued briefly outside as
the place was bustling with locals, I couldn't see any other foreigners though.
Once inside we were shown to our table. There was a rather chaotic atmosphere
as waiters rushed back and forth shouting at each other and delivering giant
tankards of beer and steaming plates of food to tables. Ordering didn't turn
out to be difficult at all. As seems to be the norm here the window was
complete with intricate plastic models of all the dishes served and the menu
had an attempt at an english translation (well I say that but they managed to
make some of the dishes sound pretty unappetizing.....like the Mexican noodles
with chorizo salt flavour). As a tourist all is expected of you is to point to
the picture of what you want and indicate how many you want.....easy! My next
challenge was to eat the noodles we ordered with chopsticks without looking
like a complete idiot and depositing most of it on the table.....I have been in
training for the last month or so but I am sad to say my technique still leaves
a lot to be desired. Whilst sipping at my lager I look around at the locals
and see to my relief that a good amount of slurping and shoveling seems to be
an acceptable technique. When the food arrived it was delicious and we polished
it off quickly. After another beer we decide that we can't manage to stay awake
much longer, David's eyes look as big as saucers and I think he might actually
fall asleep and drown if he orders another beer. We pay up and wander back to
hotel, only momentarily distracted by the corner shop where we buy a haagan
dazs icecream for dessert. Then it is off to bed for a well deserved night
sleep!
