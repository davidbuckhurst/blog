2009 turned out to be another rubbish year of cinema. I nearly retired altogether from filmgoing after watching the abysmal *Terminator Salvation*. In fact I was barely able to think of enough films to compile a top 10 list. Also -- regrettably -- I didn't manage to see a number of the higher rated films of the year: *The Hurt Locker*, *Gomorrah* (both crappy limited releases) and *Ponyo* (stupid UK distributers).

1. *A Serious Man*
2. *The Wrestler*
3. *Moon*
4. *Synecdoche, New York*
5. *Drag Me to Hell*
6. *Fantastic Mr Fox*
7. *Antichrist*
8. *Inglorious Basterds*
9. *District 13*
10. *Avatar*

*Wolverine* and *Star Trek* weren't bad either, but we're still only talking 12 films this year that were any good. My 3 worst films of the year are:

1. *Terminator Salvation*
2. *Transformers 2*
3. *Fast and Furious*

... although there were some pretty diabolical trailers that I can't even begin to contemplate.
