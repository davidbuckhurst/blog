title: "Top 10 Albums of the Last Decade"
categories: blog

Ok, so this is the really hard one. Most of the so-called critics had a top 10 list in January, but a true professional like me needs at least till mid-July to work this sort of thing out. The consequences of getting something like this wrong are truly mind-blowing. So, starting from number 10:

10. Funeral -- Arcade Fire
Arcade Fire brought a really great sound to the decade, proving there was life after post rock, and that you can never have too many people in your band. An exciting and messy musical mutation that earned a lot of time in my CD-player.

9. Honeycomb -- Frank Black
The legendary singer-songwriter creates his perfect album. I imagine this is one I'll still be listening to in 30 years time. A mix of covers and new material all adding up to the best country album ever made.

8. Dig Lazarus Dig -- Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds
Emerging from the brilliant Grinderman experiment, Nick Cave brings a fresh take to his Bad Seeds sound, and at least his best album since the flawless No More Shall You Part. Midnight Man alone would get a lesser album into this list.

7. Cassadaga -- Bright Eyes
Better than everything that came before it, and then some. Connor Oberst delivers one of those truly great albums. This guy gets better and better. (The two subsequent Mystical Valley Band albums are almost good enough to make this list too, but I didn't want to overload this selection with Connor Oberst.)

6. Illinois -- Sufjan Stevens
5 years on, and Sufjan still hasn't released a follow-up to this masterpiece. And it's no wonder. This really is a terrific and epic recording that really justifies the very concept of the the album.

5. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah -- Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
The freshest sound of the decade. Totally indescribable and inimitable. Both albums this decade are worth picking up (Â£3 each last time I looked).

4. Z -- My Morning Jacket
The Jacket are really one of those stand-out bands from the last 10 years. Shame no one's ever heard of them in this country. These guys deserve to be big outside of the US and have a great rock sound and playful energy that is seriously lacking in today's charisma-free rock groups.

3. Ys -- Johanna Newsom
Epic country pixie singing! A sort of Appalachian Bjork. Not for everyone, but stick with it and the themes and melodies of this epic yet delicate album will charm you and bring you back time and again. A real treat.

2. Kid A -- Radiohead
Released in 2000, so just making it to this list. Radiohead's finest album sits very near the top of my list. Also worth mentioning: In Rainbows, their latest, effort is nearly as good.

1. Takk -- Sigur Ros
I didn't think they could do better than ( ), but with Takk they trounce the desolation of that superb album with an even more phenomenal celebration of life, happiness, and pixie singing. Everyone should own this album, it's a true masterpiece and a delightful listen every time I put it on.

Special mention needs to go to Kate Bush's Aerial. The Killers' Sam's Town. And Godspeed You Black Emperor's Yanqui UXO. If This was a top 13 I would probably have posted this by March. Predictions for the next decade? Sufjan Stevens will occupy 9/10 positions in the list, with a single Godspeed album at position 10. You'll see.
