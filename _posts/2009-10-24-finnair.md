Before we get to the wonders of Tokyo; it's worth a summary of our Finnair
experience. Our journey took us via Helsinki, with a 90 minute transfer and
ample chance to explore Helsinki terminal 2. The flight itself was fairly
uneventful: a moderate lunch, entertainmentless flight, and the rather
delightful discovery of *Lapin Kulta*, Finnair's number one beer (their
number 2 (*Koff*), is disappointingly average unfortunately.) Helsinki
airport was another fine surprise: a super-efficient exercise in speedy
transfers (try the pepperoni pizza and Lapin Kulta if you have more than 10
minutes to wait), concentrating on simple and navigable airport layout rather
than just trying to sell you stuff. Listening to the Finnish announcers telling
passengers to "hurry up" was enough entertainment in itself.

The second leg of the journey was even more pleasant with a modern, spacious
plane, widescreen LCD displays mounted in all the seats, and a
*Bring me Lapin Kulta button* in your seat. We watched the very entertaining
*Hangover* and tried to get some sleep. Our only criticism the appalling and
unidentifiable meals, one of which was simply identified as beef, the other: egg.
